*Sonic Adventure 2* [Speedruns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrunning) involve players completing the game as quickly as possible. 
This is achieved in videogames often by using techniques and glitches to minimize time finishing the game. The speedrunning community for 
*Sonic Adventure 2* focuses on different categories, such as the most popular category "**Hero Story**" and subcategories like "**180 Emblems**"
and "**Any%**". Players will often compete for world record times and engage in a community dedicated to mastering skills within the game. 
Speedrunning *Sonic Adventure 2* showcases a different perspective on how to beat the game through community efforts to find new techniques and 
glitches to achieve the fastest possible completion times. *Sonic Adventure 2* was also used as a reference for the live action
*Sonic the Hedgehog 3* film. [[1]](https://www.gamesradar.com/sonic-3-tease-sonic-adventure-2-inspiration/)

## Hero Story
The "Hero Story" in *Sonic Adventure 2* focuses on Sonic the Hedgehog (main protagonist) and his allies Tails and Knuckles as they work together
to stop Dr. Eggman and his evil plans to conquer the world. [[2]](https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/22/sonic-adventure-2) In the speedrunning community, the "Hero Story" is one of the most popular categories
for *Sonic Adventure 2*. The community for *Sonic Adventure 2* speedrunning has created a competitive scene for getting the fastest times beating
the game. Many players would upload their times to websites such as [Speedrun.com](Speedrun.com). Players would also directly compete against 
each other during events such as [Games Done Quick (GDQ)](gamesdonequick.com) where live races would take place. Players would devise skips such
as "Crazy Gadget Skip Skip" and "Final Rush Skip" to get faster times. [[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfFbui-9du8&themeRefresh=1) These skips would often "break" the game by bypassing certain sections of
the game which was intended to be played normally. The story would end in an epic battle against Dr. Eggman and his final weapon, with Sonic and
his team eventually saving the day.
### Dark Story
The "**Dark Story**" in *Sonic Adventure 2* focuses on the antagonists of the game being Dr. Eggman, Shadow the Hedgehog, and Rouge the Bat. This is
a less popular speedrunning category as players have found the category to have a tough barrier of entry with many cruical skips at the beginning
being tough to do. [[4]](https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/xyaz1c/the_skip_that_killed_dark_story_speedruns_in/?rdt=61028) While players do play this category, many players prefer "**Hero Story**" as the category to play and compete in. 

## 180 Emblems
In *Sonic Adventure 2*, there are 180 Emblems throughout the game available for a player to collect. The 180 emblems can be collected by clearing
levels, completing missions, collecting chaos emeralds, and through unlocked bonus/secret stages. For players looking to 100% complete the game
collecting the 180 emblems is essential. Collecting 180 emblems is considered a great achievement for players whether they are speedrunning or 
not. The "**180 Emblems**" category in *Sonic Adventure 2* speedrunning is considered a subcategory where the goal is not to necessarily beat the 
game but rather to complete the challenge of obtaining 180 Emblems. Many players play this category of speedrunning alongside "**Any%**" runs 
where any percent of the game can be completed. The community competing in this category has looked to optimize routes and plans to collect the 
180 Emblems as fast as possible creating skips and guides to reduce time.

## Any%
A "**Any%**" speedrun is a staple among the speedrunning community as a whole with it being a popular choice for players across all videogames. 
The speedrunning category measures the time it takes to beat a game no matter how much of it is played. In the context of *Sonic Adventure 2*, 
Any% speedruns may consist of 100% completion of clearing levels or collecting emblems. Any% speedruns also include beating the game with or 
without skips often separating runs into subcategories like "**skipless**" or "**glitchless**". The most popular approach to an Any% speedrun 
is to use skips and glitches to find the fastest time possible to beat the game. The Any% category is a staple in the general speedrunning 
community and *Sonic Adventure 2* speedrunning is no exception. The Any% category provides *Sonic Adventure 2* speedrunners creative freedom 
to push boundaries on how fast the game can be beat.
